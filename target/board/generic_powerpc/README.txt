The "generic_powerpc" product defines a non-hardware-specific PowerPC target
without a kernel or bootloader.

It can be used to build the entire user-level system, and
will work with the PowerPC version of the emulator,

It is not a product "base class"; no other products inherit
from it or use it in any way.
